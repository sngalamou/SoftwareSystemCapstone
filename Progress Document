General statements like reading or worked on without specificity will not give you the full amount of points. But since it is early in the semester and you may have not found a project yet or are just new to it, this report can focus on the search and what software or web-tools you have been looking at.Any Panapto video(s) that correlate with your document submission will be given extra credit.

I was unable to accomplish all that I wanted in the previous week. Due to outside circumstances I was registered for class the first week of school and could not access the course and didn't complete the coursework for the week.
To combat these I plan on completing my work as early as possible to mitigate the possibility of something on being able to turn in assignments.
My goals for the next week are:
1. Complete progress doc 3
2. Read chapter 4 in Code V2
