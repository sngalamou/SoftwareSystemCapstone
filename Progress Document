I was unable to accomplish all that I wanted in the previous week. Due to outside circumstances I was registered for class the first week of school and could not access the course and didn't complete the coursework for the week.
To combat these I plan on completing my work as early as possible to mitigate the possibility of something on being able to turn in assignments.
My goals for the next week are:
1. Complete progress doc 3
2. Read chapter 4 in Code V2
